# Figure 1 

Physiology PCA panels on top, bleaching in the middle, survivorship probability on the bottom. Come back to: other way around?

### 3 phases 
Start with pca_data subsetted to each species 

Need to run Statistics.Rmd, Photographic_Bleaching.Rmd, Survivorship.Rmd first
```{r}
## mcap.three; pacuta.three = phys plots
## splots[[1]] = mcap surv; splots[[2]] = pacuta surv
## Blch_plot = color score 

ggarrange(Blch_plot, ggarrange(mcap.three, pacuta.three,
          labels = c("A", "B")),
          nrow=2)

```
