#General boxplot
ggplot(Quahog, aes(x=Solutions, y=Heart_Rate, color=Solutions)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()

# General violin plot
ggplot(Quahog, aes(x=Solutions, y=Heart_Rate, color=Solutions)) + geom_violin() + theme_classic()

# Descriptive Statistics
### you can make this part more specific to the different solutions so you're not just getting one mean for the entire dataset
stat.desc(Quahog)
summary(Quahog)

#ANOVA test
ANOVA = aov(Heart_Rate ~ Solutions, data=Quahog)
summary(ANOVA) # statistical test that will tell IF one or more groups are significantly different
TukeyHSD(ANOVA) # Tukey Post-Hoc tells you which group is significantly different
