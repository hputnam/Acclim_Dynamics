Surface Area by Wax Dipping. 

1. Clear your workspace and set your working directory to where you've saved the weights file.
```{r}

```

2. Install and load the 'tidyverse' package. 
```{r}

```

3. Read in the datasheet with the wax weights.
```{r}

```

4. We need to find the difference in weight for each standard curve dowel.
Create a new column with the values of weight2 column - weight1 column. 
You will never have to make any edits to the original datasheet, do all of this in R.
```{r}

```

5. Create a new variable called "standards" that only includes the rows that read "Standard" in the Sample column.
Hint: this is called subsetting.
```{r}

```

6. To create a standard curve we need to make a linear model. 
The function for a linear model is lm(datasheet_name$Y_variable ~ datasheet_name$X_variable, data = the variable from #5)
```{r}

```

7. Plot this linear model by plotting delta mass from #4 on the x axis and Surface area on the Y axis. 
```{r}

```

8. To interpret our linear model we need to know the R^2 value, the range of surface area, and the range of surface area. 
We need an R^2 value above 0.98 to have confidence in our standard curve and when we dip the coral skeletons we need the change in weight to be within the range of the standard curve. 
You can use the summary and range functions. 
```{r}

```

Calculate the surface area of the coral skeletons.
9. Create a new variable called "samples" that only includes the rows that read "Coral" in the Sample column.
```{r}

```

10. Create a column with calculated surface area. 
This is in y=mx+b format. 
linear_model_name$coefficients[2] * smpls$delta.mass.g + stnd.curve$coefficients[1]
This will pull the second coefficient which is the slope, multiply it by the change in mass of a coral sample, and then add the first coefficient which is the y intercept. 
```{r}
# View the coefficients of this linear model
linear_model_name$coefficients
```

11. Create an .csv file that outputs the surface area of each coral. 
```{r}

```
