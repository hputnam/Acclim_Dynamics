### Generalized additive models
Ross said this might be helpful.

Generalized linear model can capture non-Gaussian distribution models compared to standard linear models.

GAMs are essentially GLMs but can capture non-linear relationships by working with "splines". The unique part of GAM is that is is composed of a sum of functions of covariates instead of or in addition to the standard linear covariates effects. Basically y does not have to be a linear function of x.

You choose a "basis" which is a choice of "splines" (i.e. cubic spline vs polynomial spline). There is also penalized estimation that essentially keeps us from overfitting our data. GAM can be thought of like a modified GLM.
Information on GAM [here](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/building_gam.html).

These models are more general with less assumptions. Less stat power?

Github code example [m-clark](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/mixedModels/mixedModelML.html#additive_model_as_a_mixed_model)
Common examples:  
- large datasets with complicated interaction effects
- Models with many parameters but not a lot of data per parameter
- Fitting a smooth trend line that allows the trend to vary by year


GAMs seem like they could be a good fit.

Do:  
- Model with lmer (ref Ariana - linear mixed models) and GAM  
- AIC model test  
- ANOVA on that model  
- PCAs  
- PERMANOVA on that matrix
