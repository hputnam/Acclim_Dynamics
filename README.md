## Coral species loss and physiological legacy effects are elicited by extended marine heatwave and projected ocean acidification conditions

Marine heatwaves are increasing in frequency and intensity, with potentially catastrophic consequences for marine taxa and ecosystems such as coral reefs. Environmentally realistic, extended heat wave and recovery time series in a multi-stressor experimental framework can therefore provide enhanced predictive capacity for the performance of such systems under climate change. We exposed two common reef-building corals in Hawaiʻi, Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta, to a two-month period of high temperature and high pCO2 conditions (29.5 °C, ~1100 ppm) or ambient conditions (27.5 °C, ~500 ppm) in a factorial design, followed by two months of return to ambient conditions. In response to high temperature, but not high pCO2 multivariate physiology shifted through time in both species,  driven by decreases in respiration rates and endosymbiont density. P. acuta exhibited more significantly and rapidly altered physiology, and substantially higher bleaching and mortality than M. capitata.  This may be driven by higher inherent rates of photosynthesis and lower initial host antioxidant capacity in P. acuta resulting in a heightened generation of and sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS) under thermal stress. Thermal tolerance may be due in part to M. capitata harboring a mixture of Cladocopium and Durusdinium spp while P. acuta was dominated by other distinct Cladocopium spp., but there was no evidence of Symbiodiniaceae shuffling due to treatment or through time. Only M. capitata survived the exposure and recovery period, but physiological state in the heatwave exposed corals remained significantly diverged at the end of the recovery period relative to M. capitata in ambient temperature. In extended heatwave and climate change stressor scenarios, our results suggest a species-specific loss of corals that may be driven by differences in inherent physiological states and Symbiodiniaceae community structure. The corals that survive these projected conditions will exhibit lasting physiological legacies that are likely to influence the holobiont’s future stress response.
