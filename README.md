## Coral species loss and physiological legacy effects are elicited by extended marine heatwave and projected ocean acidification conditions

Emma Strand, Kevin Wong, Alexa Farraj, Sierra Gray, Ana McMenamin, and Hollie Putnam. [Putnam Lab, University of Rhode Island]. 

This repository contains data, scripts, protocols, and analyses for physiological responses and Symbiodiniaceae community compositions of *Montipora capitata* and *Pocillopora acuta* during a simulated extended heatwave and ocean acidification stress and recovery time-series. This work was conducted in 2018 at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.

### Data Organization 

This repository is organized by `Output`, `Protocols`, `Scripts`, `data`, and `metadata`. 

`data` is categorized into subfolders: `Environmental`, `ITS2_seq`, and `Physiological_variables`. `Environmental` includes all temperature, pH, light, flow rate data, and total alkalinity measurements of experimental tanks. 

`Physiological_variables` folder include data for the following:  
- Survivorship   
- Color Score   
- Growth Rates (via Buoyant Weight)  
- Respiration rates  
- Photosynthetic rates and photosynthetic irradiance curves   
- Host soluble protein  
- Host total antioxidant capacity  
- Endosymbiont densities  
- Chlorophyll content   
- Host and symbiont tissue biomass

`ITS2_seq` folder includes all data for Symbiodiniaceae communities analyzed by ITS2 Sequencing. All raw sequences are uploaded to NCBI under [PRJNA761780](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA761780). 

`Output` includes all physiological and Symbiodiniaceae community analyses conducted with R markdown scripts organized in `Scripts` and figures produced.
