<a name="Sample_Prep"></a> **Adult Tissue Sample Preparation**

**Total Protein**
1. Thaw the 1,000 μL homogenate aliquot.  
2. Vortex to re-suspend the symbiont cell pellet.   
5. Add 10 μL of 1M NaOH (pH should be ~10) to the tube.  
6. Pipette a very small amount of sample onto pH paper to confirm the pH ~10.  
7. Incubate the tube at 50&deg;C for 4 hours shaking at 300 rpm.  
8. Add 280 μL of 0.1M HCl to the tube to neutralize the sample. Add this volume in small amounts and continue to test the pH of the sample using pH paper. pH needs to be at 7.0 to move onto the next steps.  
9. **_It is critical to know exactly how much volume was added_**

**Soluble Protein**
1. Thaw the 1,000 mL homogenate aliquot.  
2. Centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 10 minutes at 4&deg;C.  
3. Aliquot the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for use for soluble protein and total antioxidant capacity protol.   

<a name="Table"></a> **Standard Table**  
**Preparation of Diluted Albumin (BSA) Standards**    
*These standards can be made during the 4 hour incubation period in the sample preparation section.*
1. Use the following table as a guide to prepare a set of protein standards. For this project we will use the microplate procedure. Diluent is DI water Type II. Each vial will be a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the Vial ID ("A", "B", etc.).  

| Vial 	| Volume of diluent (uL) 	| Volume and source of BSA (µL) 	| Final BSA concentration (µg/mL) 	|
|------	|------------------------	|-------------------------------	|---------------------------------	|
| A    	| 0                      	| 300 (stock)                   	| 2,000                           	|
| B    	| 62.5                   	| 187.5 (stock)                 	| 1,500                           	|
| C    	| 100                    	| 100 (stock)                   	| 1,000                           	|
| D    	| 100                    	| 100 (vial B dilution)         	| 750                             	|
| E    	| 100                    	| 100 (vial C dilution)         	| 500                             	|
| F    	| 100                    	| 100 (vial E dilution)         	| 250                             	|
| G    	| 100                    	| 100 (vial F dilution)         	| 125                             	|
| H    	| 160                    	| 40 (vial G dilution)          	| 25                              	|
| I    	| 200                    	| 0                             	| 0                               	|

**Preparation of the BCA Working Reagent (WR)**   
1. Use the following formula to determine the total volume of WR required:  
(# standards + # unknowns) x (# replicates) x (volume of WR per sample) = total volume WR required. For this project, we will use 9 standards and 200 μL of WR is required for each sample in the microplate procedure.   
> *(9 standards + # samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = total volume WR required*  
(9 standards + 10 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 7,600 μL WR  
(9 standards + 20 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 11,600 μL WR  
(9 standards + 40 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 19,600 μL WR  

2. Prepare WR by mixing 50 parts of BCA Reagent A with 1 part of BCA Reagent B (50:1, Reagent A:B) in a sterile glass bottle of the appropriate size based on how many samples are going to be run.  

**Microplate Procedure (Sample to WR ratio = 1:8) from Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit:**  
1. Pipette 20 μL of each standard or unknown sample into microplate wells in duplicate.  
2. Add 200 μL of the working reagent (WR) to each well and mix the plate thoroughly on a plate shaker for 30 seconds.  
3. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.  
4. Measure the absorbance at or near 480 nm on a plate reader.
5. Subtract the average 480 nm absorbance measurement of the Blank standard replicates from the 480 nm measurements of all other individual standard and unknown sample replicates.  
6. Prepare a standard curve by plotting the average Blank-corrected 480 nm measurement for each BSA standard vs. its concentration in μg/mL. Use the standard curve to determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample.
