1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
    - 	100% acetone
    - 	flammable safe fridge 4°C
    - 	**quartz** 96 well plate
    - 	1ml pipette and tips
    -  1.5 ml microfuge tubes

**Sample Preparation**  
1. Thaw homogenate aliquot.  
2. Centrifuge the 1000 μL aliquot of adult homogenate at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes to separate the host and Symbiodiniaceae cells.  
3. Remove and discard the supernatant.  
4. Add 1 mL of 100% acetone to the pellet in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and vortex the tubes for 15 sec.  
5. Place tubes in the dark at 4°C for 24 hours.  
6. Vortex the tubes for 15 sec.  
7. Spin the tubes down at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes to pellet any debris.  
8. Pipette 200µl of sample to duplicate wells of 96-well quartz plate.   
9. Pipette 200µl of acetone blank to duplicate wells.  
10. Cover the plate with silicone pad to reduce evaporate as samples are added.  
11. Remove silicon pad.   
12. Measure the extract Absorbance on a plate reader spectrophotometer at 630, 663, and 750 nm in a 96-well quartz plate.
13. Standardize for path length in 200µl of sample in 96-well quartz plate.

**Calculating Chlorophyll Concentration**  

Chlorophyll a and c2 concentrations are calculated from the equations in [Jeffrey and Humphrey 1975](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0015379617307783?token=0937035D38C07F29ADF00F1F2A21F20F221219B1CC11A444A4F84D16B98EC3A6AD941D191BA2135A68C98BA62A0B69FE) after substracting A750nm from all measurements.
