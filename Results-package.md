**Response variables:**  
Molecular: Symbiont community assemblage (ITS2 Seq), bacterial community assemblage (16S Seq),  Pocillopora acuta identity (mtORF Seq), gene expression patterns (RNASeq), DNA methylation patterns (WGBS; MBD-BS).  
Holobiont physiology: protein content, total antioxidant capacity, chlorophyll concentration, tissue biomass, symbiont density.  
Metabolism: respiration and photosynthetic rates.   

**List of missing corals**:  
The following have been lost in transit from HIMB to URI or misplaced in a freezer in either location. I've checked URI's freezers and neighboring lab's freezers multiple times. This will decrease the sample sizes of several groups down to 2 at the smallest in Day 2 and Week 1.

### Univariate Physiology Results   

**Survivorship**

![suv](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/All_survivorship.png?raw=true)

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210108.  

**Bleaching Score**

![blch](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Photographic_Bleaching.png?raw=true)

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210108.

**Growth**

![grw](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Growth.png?raw=true)  

1.) Do we like the above format? Or the format of the bleaching score figure?  
2.) *P.acuta* Week 10 and 14 have the same value? This doesn't seem likely?
