900 corals, 450 *M. capitata* and 450 *P. acuta*, were collected from 6 sites in Kaneohe Bay, Hawai'i. These corals were randomly assigned treatment tanks.  

ATAC = Ambient Temperature (27C) Ambient pCO2 (~480 uatm)
ATHC = Ambient Temperature (27C) High pCO2 (~1,200 uatm)    
HTAC = High Temperature (29.5C) Ambient pCO2 (~480 uatm)
HTHC = High Temperature (29.5C) High pCO2 (~1,200 uatm)

**Response variables:**  
Molecular: Symbiont community assemblage (ITS2 Seq), bacterial community assemblage (16S Seq),  Pocillopora acuta identity (mtORF Seq), gene expression patterns (RNASeq), DNA methylation patterns (WGBS; MBD-BS).  
Holobiont physiology: protein content, total antioxidant capacity, chlorophyll concentration, tissue biomass, symbiont density.  
Metabolism: respiration and photosynthetic rates.   

**List of missing corals**:  
The following have been lost in transit from HIMB to URI or misplaced in a freezer in either location. I've checked URI's freezers and neighboring lab's freezers multiple times. This will decrease the sample sizes of several groups down to 2 at the smallest in Day 2 and Week 1.

## Sample Sizes

We had a time-limited first day of sampling in the field, resulting in the following sample sizes:

| Species     	| Timepoint 	| Treatment 	| Sample Size 	|
|-------------	|-----------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 1     	| ATHC      	| 2           	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 1     	| ATHC      	| 2           	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 1     	| HTHC      	| 2           	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 1     	| HTHC      	| 2           	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 1     	| HTAC      	| 4           	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 1     	| ATAC      	| 4           	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 1     	| ATAC      	| 4           	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 1     	| HTAC      	| 4           	|

Due to lower survivorship, recovery periods will have decreased sample sizes in the following:  

| Species     	| Timepoint 	| Treatment 	| Sample Size 	| Notes                    	|
|-------------	|-----------	|-----------	|-------------	|--------------------------	|
| P. acuta    	| 12 week   	| HTAC      	| 2           	| will only be 2 available 	|
| M. capitata 	| 12 week   	| ATAC      	| 5           	| will only be 5 available 	|
| M. capitata 	| 12 week   	| HTHC      	| 5           	| will only be 5 available 	|
| M. capitata 	| 16 week   	| HTAC      	| 4           	| will only be 4 available 	|
| M. capitata 	| 16 week   	| ATHC      	| 5           	| will only be 5 available 	|
| M. capitata 	| 16 week   	| HTHC      	| 5           	| will only be 5 available 	|

Due to the list of missing corals, the following groups will have decreased sample sizes.  

| Species     	| Timepoint 	| Treatment 	| Sample Size 	| Notes              	|
|-------------	|-----------	|-----------	|-------------	|--------------------	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 2     	| ATHC      	| 4           	| 2976, 3003 missing 	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 2     	| ATHC      	| 4           	| 2752, 2880 missing 	|
| M. capitata 	| Day 2     	| HTHC      	| 4           	| 2008, 2512 missing 	|
| P. acuta    	| Day 2     	| HTHC      	| 4           	| 2522, 2523 missing 	|
| M. capitata 	| 1 week    	| ATHC      	| 4           	| 2740, 2528 missing 	|
| P. acuta    	| 1 week    	| ATHC      	| 4           	| 2981, 2984 missing 	|
| M. capitata 	| 1 week    	| HTHC      	| 4           	| 1603, 2200 missing 	|
| P. acuta    	| 1 week    	| HTHC      	| 4           	| 1739, 2859 missing 	|

Some univariate physiology variables will also have decreased sample size groups, see each section for additional notes.

## Univariate Physiology Results   

### Survivorship

![suv](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/All_survivorship.png?raw=true)

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210108.  

### Bleaching Score

![blch](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Photographic_Bleaching.png?raw=true)

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210108.

### Growth

![grw](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Growth.png?raw=true)  

1.) Do we like the figure format for Growth, Resp/photo rates, or AFDW/Chl?   
2.) *P.acuta* Week 10 and 14 have the same value? This doesn't seem likely?

Figure as of 20210108.

### Respiration and photosynthetic rates

![resp](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Respirometry.png?raw=true)

No additional groups with a decreased sample size.

### Tissue Biomass (AFDW)

![AFDW](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Tissue_Biomass.png?raw=true)

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210108.

In addition to the missing list above, we won't have data for:  
- 1174: there was no homogenate tissue in this falcon tube. Aliquots were made so this coral will have Chl, Prot, TAC, cell density.    
- 1327: gained mass in AFDW protocol (not possible); not enough homogenate to do again.  
- 1488: homogenate tube broke (froze and cracked) and we lost half of tissue homogenate. There was not enough left to do AFDW. There will be data for Chl, Prot, TAC, cell density.

Need to re-do #2863. "Host" written down twice in notebook.

**AFDW sample size differences in addition to the 3 above sample size tables.**

| P. acuta    	| 8 week    	| HTAC      	| 5           	| 1327 no data                                    	|
| P. acuta    	| 8 week    	| HTHC      	| 5           	| 1174 no data                                    	|

### Chlorophyll concentration

| Species  	| Timepoint 	| Treatment 	| Sample Size 	| Notes                                       	|

P-2156 missing data; need to look at notebook photos to find this.  

This dataset has been QC'd by Emma; final figure as of 20210118.

### Soluble Protein

![prot](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Host-Soluble-Protein.png?raw=true)

Week 4 P. acuta ATHC big drop, but samples are not in outlier tests. This still looks weird to me?

No additional groups with a decreased sample size.

### Total Antioxidant Capacity

![TAC](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/Output/Final_Figures/Total-Antioxidant-Capacity.png?raw=true)

No additional groups with a decreased sample size.

Week 4 ATHC P acuta points look wonky like the protein values. Day 2 and Week 1 have very small sample sizes likely leading to large variation above?

October 7th (3 plates) were done with an incorrectly diluted stop solution. Decide if need to be re-done.  

Still having an issue with the standard curve variation. According to the [assay kit protocol](https://www.cellbiolabs.com/sites/default/files/STA-360-total-antioxidant-capacity-assay-kit.pdf), 1 mM concentration should be around 1.35 Abs490. The closest st. curve was from Nov 10th plate. All points have been projected onto the st. curve from Nov 10th and TAC calculated from this st. curve. We still need to address this.

TAC calculation done by:  

1. UAE * 2189. Convert to CRE  
2. CRE.umol.L (from Step 1) * (homog vol/1000)  
3. CRE.umol.mgprot = CRE.umol.L (from Step 2) / (prot ug / 1000)

```
TAC <- left_join(TAC.values, metadata) %>%
   mutate(cre.umol.L = uae.mM * 2189) %>%   # Convert to CRE (see product manual) per unit sample volume
   mutate(cre.umol = cre.umol.L * (vol_mL / 1000),  # Convert to CRE per coral by multiplying by homog. vol.
          cre.umol.mgprot = cre.umol / (prot_ug / 1000))  # Convert to CRE per mg protein by dividing by total protein
```

This is still producing very small values (0.04840641-1.60261156 CRE umol.mg prot). The above calculation is what was recommended by Hollie and Ross. So we have to divide by liters to get uM.mg prot to compare to the literature?
